# Sudoku_solver
R Shiny app for solving sudoku puzzles via binary integer programming.

I wrote the solver code many years ago, and put it in this app via some Sudoku plotting code derived from here: https://github.com/EconometricsBySimulation/2013-06-14-Sudoku

I plan to make the solver code much cleaner at some point, as it's not very transparent right now.
